# Ruby style guide

This is the configuration for Loyalty NZ's Ruby Style Guide, used by the [Rubocop
gem](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) for our Ruby repositories.

Rubocop uses the widely accepted [Bbatsov Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) as its base ruleset. Loyalty NZ's configuration is designed to give developers more freedom with things like whitespace and syntax (as long as they are consistent).

Our intention with modifying the rules are to "pick up the howlers" rather than stifle development teams with overzealous policy.

For the list of Loyalty NZ modifications to the Bbatsov rules see [.rubocop.yml](ruby/.rubocop.yml)
